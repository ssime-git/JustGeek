# Welcome to JustGeek

## Pipelines over buzzwords

I'm the engineer who swapped finite-element meshes for neural networks — same fight, different toolchain: decompose, understand, optimize. Around here we dig into MLOps, Data Engineering, and pragmatic AI with one obsession: reliable systems that can take a beating, just like the turbines I used to watch. 

I care about pipelines that roll, releases that stay clean, and monitoring that never gaslights you. If tech is your playground, pour a ☕ and dive in — we're going to build, explain, and push models to production without the drama (okay, maybe a pinch of drama for fun).

So let's roll! 😜

## What you'll find here

- **MLOps dispatches** – infra patterns, deployment hygiene, and how to keep uptime sacred.
- **Data engineering craft** – orchestration, storage, and keeping pipelines healthy at scale.
- **Applied AI breakdowns** – translating research into systems you can actually ship.
- **Post-mortems & playbooks** – lessons from the edge cases, monitoring stacks, and on-call war stories.
