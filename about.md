# About JustGeek

## Engineering mindset, applied to AI

I bring an engineering attitude to machine learning: rigor, pragmatism, and a soft spot for systems that last. I went from mechanical simulation to orchestrating models in production, but the red thread never changed—reduce surprises, log what matters, automate the rest. If reliability is your love language, we're on the same wavelength.

## What drives the blog

- **Reliability over hype** – architecture choices that stand up in real environments.
- **Traceability by design** – observability patterns, data contracts, and practical governance.
- **Automation with taste** – CI/CD for ML, feature pipelines, and guardrails that scale.

## Why write here

JustGeek is my space to publish deep dives, battle-tested retros, and hands-on walkthroughs that turn ML ideas into concrete impact. The posts favor clarity over fluff, code over slides, and learning by building.

## Stay in touch

- Ping me for collaborations, audits, or simply to nerd out about MLOps

Thanks for reading — now let's keep shipping systems that behave.
